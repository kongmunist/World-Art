# World Art, Winner at Hack112 (Largest hackathon at CMU)


Welcome to our Hack112 Project! We made an image-to-map converter. Here is our video explaining the process.

A set of python scrips converts an image to its barebones contours, and then maps its coordinates. We used Google Map APIs to create the link. Here's some examples!

Starting position of the route and size of the created image are all customizable through options that we did not make user-friendly to figure out. Hope you enjoy!
