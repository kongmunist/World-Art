# World Art, Winner at Hack112 (Largest hackathon at CMU)


Welcome to our Hack112 Project! We made an image-to-map converter. Here is our video explaining the process.

A set of python scrips converts an image to its barebones contours, and then maps its coordinates. We used Google Map APIs to create the link.
Hope you enjoy!
